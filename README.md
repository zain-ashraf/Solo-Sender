# Solo Sender
 
IOS App that takes in a message and a list of phone numbers, and sends the message to every phone number indiviudally without turning them into a groupchat.
Each message is sent with a 4 second delay to ensure that the message is being sent to the correct number with the option to cancel incase it is not the right number.

Potential upcoming updates:


add a contact list to select from, rather than having to type the numbers

change the delay to a pause that only continues once the message is sent or cancelled

updated user interface
